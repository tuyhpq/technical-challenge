## Technology and Architecture of the application?

The project is built on top of Vue CLI, a full system for rapid Vue.js development.  
See [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/).

Overall, the core of the project is `Vue 3`, a progressive framework for building user interfaces. We use `Bootstrap 5` to build responsive sites, and use `io-ts fp-ts` for runtime type system for IO decoding/encoding.

## Which chart do you use and why did you choose it?

I have used line chart and bar chart for the application. Simply because of its popularity. People can easily understand the information I want to convey.

## Which information that user will acquire from your application?

Live statistics and coronavirus news tracking the number of confirmed cases, recovered patients, and death toll due to the COVID-19. The graph shows the correlation between the number of new cases and the number of people recovering daily. Search and view the epidemic situation in each country.
